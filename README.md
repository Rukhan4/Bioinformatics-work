This repository contains several different python and R scripts containing algorithms generated to learn and effectively automate Bioinformatics tasks.

# Biology Meets Programming
_a course offered by UCSD_ 

BMP - Biology Meets Programming

see the BMP.md file for the annotation and reasoning behind the use of each algorithm. Programming Language: Python

# Bioinformatics Specialization 
_a course offered by UCSD_

**The code in this repository is sourced from ROSALIND - A free online Bioinformatics Algorithms learning platform**

NOTE: The dunder(name) == dunder("main") module name method was only employed starting from Bioinformatics III Week 5.

# Data Analysis for Life Sciences
_a course offered by Harvard_

consists of 4 courses in R 

the .gitignore file contains all the prop material and is filtered out.
Folder contains all the algorithms and techniques I employed to advance through the assignments of the course.
